															<h2>About us :</h2>
															
															<p>Smart Cookie is teacher student reward program. With this project we are trying 

to develop an environment where Teachers and Students will give Real-Time 

reward points to each other for various activities which include co-curricular and 

extracurricular.</p>

<p>There is a hierarchy in which cookie admin plays a vital role. Cookie Admin has the 

whole and sole right to distribute points to any school or college. Once any school 

or college gets registered with smart cookie then cookie admin distributes some 

specific amount of points to school admin for further distribution. School Admin 

distributes these points to teachers (green points) and students (blue points) for 

assigning reward and ThanQ points. The reward given by teacher to his students 

will be in the form of green colored points. At the same time any student can give 

ThanQ points to his teachers and it is represented in blue colored points. If the 

points given by school admin to teachers and students for distribution are not 

sufficient then teachers/students can purchase it from cookie admin as water 

points and use it for distributions.</p>
